# Tweaking-the-Clones
Tweaking the Imax B6AC Clones

This is a follower to Stawels Github on Cheali software.

When i first considered to dive into supporting stawel, i thought of possibilities to tweak the clones mainly on minor Software modifications of their original Soft to tweak bugs.

In attempting to analyze my available clones i found so many problems in them the idea came up the different bugs of the available clones maybe a swell suitable to identify the clone type as well. In general, many people on Stawels groub still seem to be unaware of the many clone types and even variations of them. 
In the end, will (at first) try to do 2 things here:

1) describe the bugs i found in my clones
2) Try to start a classification system to identify the clones wit respect to their bugs, means even without opening them.
